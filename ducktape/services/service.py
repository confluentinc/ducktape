    information about the service so that other services or test scripts can
    easily be configured to work with them. Finally, they may be able to collect
    and check logs/output from the service, which can be helpful in writing tests
    or benchmarks.

    Services should generally be written to support an arbitrary number of nodes,
    even if instances are independent of each other. They should be able to assume
    that there won't be resource conflicts: the cluster tests are being run on
    should be large enough to use one instance per service instance.
